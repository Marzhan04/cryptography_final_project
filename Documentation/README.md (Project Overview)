CryptoVault - Cryptographic Security Suite (Flask)
Course: MAT364 – Cryptography
Team: Narikbayeva Aruzhan, Abdibayeva Marzhan,Kenzhegulova Nuray 

Project Overview

CryptoVault is a cryptographic security suite built using Flask. This project demonstrates the integration of various cryptographic techniques, including:

Secure authentication with bcrypt and TOTP
Secure file encryption (AES-GCM, SHA-256, HMAC)
Blockchain-based audit ledger using Merkle Trees and Proof of Work (PoW)
Block mining and validation using PoW
This project showcases a basic implementation of secure messaging and file encryption, coupled with a blockchain ledger that records important actions (such as file encryption and login).

Project Features
Authentication: User registration, login with password and TOTP (two-factor authentication).
File Encryption: Files can be securely encrypted and decrypted using AES-GCM, with integrity verification via SHA-256 and HMAC.
Blockchain Ledger: Blockchain is used to log events such as login and file encryption, with Merkle Trees and PoW ensuring data integrity.
Mining: A simple PoW mechanism where blocks are mined by finding a nonce that results in a hash with a required number of leading zeros.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Flask (Web Framework)
cryptography (For AES, HMAC, RSA)
pyotp (For TOTP)
bcrypt (Password hashing)
json (For blockchain data storage)
time (For timestamps)

Demo

Registration: Register a new user, then log in using a password and TOTP (Google Authenticator or similar).

File Encryption: Upload a file and encrypt it with a password. The encrypted file will be stored, and its hash will be logged in the blockchain.

Blockchain: Navigate to the blockchain page to view all events (login, file encryption) recorded in the blockchain.

Mining: After events are logged, mine new blocks into the blockchain using Proof of Work, which solves a nonce.

Security Considerations
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is used for multi-factor authentication.
Files are encrypted using AES-GCM and verified with HMAC for integrity.
The blockchain ensures that actions (such as login and file encryption) cannot be tampered with.
